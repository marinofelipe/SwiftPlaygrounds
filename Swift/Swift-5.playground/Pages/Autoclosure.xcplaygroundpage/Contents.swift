 # Autoclosure

 An autoclosure is a closure that is automatically created to wrap an expression that’s being passed as an argument to a function. It doesn’t take any arguments, and when it’s called, it returns the value of the expression that’s wrapped inside of it.

 > Overusing autoclosures can make your code hard to understand. The context and function name should make it clear that evaluation is being deferred.
